This repository contains solutions to the problems given in speed coding competition held on 04/04/19 in CUI Sahiwal.
If you have any problem in understanding the code or dont know what a variable is doing then contact me on hamzaislam101@gmail.com. 
I will be really happy to help you.
There will be problems in understanding as I dont have given reasonable names to the variables so feel free to contact me.
I'll try my best to optimize the code
